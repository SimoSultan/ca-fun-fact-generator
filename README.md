## Description

A random little app that will ask if you want to know a random fact about Chuck Norris.


---


## Motivation

We were practicing using Gems for Ruby, and this is what I chose from the Faker Gem.


---


# Resources

* [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) - Used to display Chuck Norris information.

## Installation Instructions

1. Follow these instructions to [download and install](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) Ruby on your computer. 
2. Download and unzip the project files onto your computer. 
3. Now navigate to the folder you want to install the game in terminal by running:
```
cd ~/ *path to folder you want to install game at*
```
4. Clone the files from this repository by copying the following command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/SimoSultan/ca-fun-fact-generator.git

5. If you have Bundler installed already, skip this step, otherwise install Bundler with:

gem install bundler
```
6. From here, navigate to the src folder of the cloned repository by copying:

7. Now copy this into terminal to run the game:

## Copyright, ethical, social issues

Copyright wasn't thought to be of concern as the game is free, open sourced and a text-based game. The only issue that was raised before development was that it can't associate with any particular branding qualities from a learning to code course. This made the game text more generic, departing from any issues surrounding this.
